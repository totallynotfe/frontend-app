# Template para site de catequese feito pelo Grupo 3

## Usage

To begin, clone the theme's source files and navigate to its root directory. Then, execute `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. This will open a preview of the template in your default browser, keep an eye out for changes in the core template files, and automatically reload the browser upon saving any modifications. To get a comprehensive list of available scripts, refer to the "package.json" file.

Running `npm run build` will build the entire project, which includes compiling assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into "dist". 

To use this build environment, make sure you have npm installed on your system.

## About

The template is based on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by Mark Otto and Jacob Thorton; and the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework created by Evan You.
