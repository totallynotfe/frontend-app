# [Agency Foxy Template](https://ryanbalieiro.github.io/foxy-template/) by Ryan Balieiro

I crafted this one-page agency portfolio theme using Vue 3.0 and Bootstrap 5. The theme comprises a range of content sections, including but not limited to a portfolio gallery, testimonials, and contact. Being fully customizable, it can be seamlessly incorporated into your business with great ease.

## Usage

To begin, clone the theme's source files and navigate to its root directory. Then, execute `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. This will open a preview of the template in your default browser, keep an eye out for changes in the core template files, and automatically reload the browser upon saving any modifications. To get a comprehensive list of available scripts, refer to the "package.json" file.

Running `npm run build` will build the entire project, which includes compiling assets, HTML, JS, and CSS into "dist". 

To use this build environment, make sure you have npm installed on your system.
